# Building Apps with the o1 Pro Template System

This is the repo for a free workshop on how to use [OpenAI's o1-pro](https://chatgpt.com/) to build full-stack web apps with a [starter template](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/mckays-app-template).

It is part 1 of a 2 part series. This is the beginner workshop. The advanced workshop will be released on February 24th.

## Workshop Video

You can find the video for this workshop on [X](https://x.com/mckaywrigley/status/1891544731496206365) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4n_p9w8pGY).

This workshop is also available in course form on [Takeoff](https://www.jointakeoff.com/) - we will continue to add to it and keep it updated with the latest model releases over time.

Use code `O1PRO` for 25% off at checkout.

I get asked all the time for an example of content on Takeoff, so hopefully this workshop gives you a feel for our content and my teaching style.

**Note**: While I _highly_ recommend using o1-pro for this workflow, you can also use o3-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and DeepSeek r1 for cheaper alternatives. However, you _will_ run into issues with those other models in this particular workflow, so I recommend using o1-pro for this workflow if possible.

## Prerequisites

You will need accounts for the following services.

They all have free plans that you can use to get started, with the exception of ChatGPT Pro (if you are using o1-pro).

- Create a [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) account
- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account
- Create a [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) account
- Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account
- Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account

You will likely not need paid plans unless you are building a business.
