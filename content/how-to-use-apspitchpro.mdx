Welcome! This guide will walk you through the key steps to make the most of your pitch creation experience. Follow these simple instructions to create a tailored, powerful pitch that meets all job requirements and significantly boosts your chances of landing an interview.

## Answering Questions: Keep it Real!

Before we dive in, let's talk about how to answer the questions within APSPitchPro. It's super important to remember you don't need to be overly formal or structured. Think of it like you're chatting with a friend, clearly explaining the actions you took.

You don't need to worry about the complexities of Integrated Leadership System (ILS) or perfectly aligning with selection criteria. Our super-smart AI handles all of that! All you need to do is choose an experience that broadly fits the selection criteria and then simply communicate that experience through our questionnaire.

## Step 1: Role Details Page

Start by entering the core details of the job you're applying for:

- **Role Name:** Enter the exact job title from the job ad, like Data Analyst or Project Manager.

- **Pitch Word Limit:** Add the maximum word count allowed for your pitch. You can find this in the Job Pack or application form.

- **APS Classification:** Select the level of the role, such as APS1, APS2 â€¦ EL1.

- **Organisation Name:** Enter the name of the organisation offering the role.

- **Role Description:** Copy and paste the full role description from the job ad, including all key details about the position and department.

## Step 2: Your Experience Page

Paste your resume and any other relevant experience details here.

## Step 3: AI Guidance Phase

After you have provided your role details and experience, our AI will analyse your submitted experience against the specified role level and selection criteria.

The system will then suggest potential experiences from your background that could be elaborated upon as STAR examples.

**Note:** While these suggestions are designed to be helpful, they are merely recommendations. If you have a different, more impactful example in mind that you believe better showcases your skills, you are encouraged to use it.

## Step 4: STAR Phase

This is where you will build the core of your pitch by detailing your chosen experiences using the STAR method. This structured approach helps recruiters understand the context of your achievements, your specific role, the actions you took, and the results you delivered.

### Situation

The first part of your STAR example sets the scene. You need to provide context for your experience.

- **Where and when did this experience occur?** Describe the setting. For instance, specify the organization, your team, and the approximate year or time frame when this experience took place. This helps the reader understand the environment in which you were operating.

- **What was the problem faced by your team or workplace?** Clearly articulate the challenge, issue, or problem that your team, division, or the broader workplace was confronting. Framing the problem effectively is important for building a compelling problem-solving narrative, which is a key component of a strong STAR example.

### Task

Next, you need to define your specific responsibilities in addressing the situation you've described.

- **What was your responsibility in addressing this issue?** Clearly state what you were tasked with or what your specific role was in tackling the problem. It is important to use "I" statements here to emphasize your personal involvement and accountability. For example, "I was tasked with developing a new reporting system," or "It was my responsibility to lead the project team."

### Action

This section is arguably the most critical part of your STAR example, as it details the specific steps you took. Recruiters pay close attention to the actions you describe.

Take a couple of minutes to think about the logical sequence of actions you took to solve the problem. Break down your approach into clear, sequential steps. For each step, describe:

- **What did you do in that step?** Be specific and provide details about your methods, techniques, and the reasoning behind your actions.

### Result

Finally, you need to demonstrate the impact of your actions by circling back to the original problem and showing how you contributed to its resolution.

- **Conclude by circling back to the original problem and proving you solved it.** Explain the outcome of your actions and how they addressed the initial challenge. Where possible, quantify your achievements with specific data, numbers, or metrics to provide concrete evidence of your success. For example, instead of saying "improved efficiency," you might say "reduced processing time by 15%."

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively use APSPitchPro to generate a high-quality, tailored pitch. Remember to review your generated pitch carefully before submission. Good luck with your application!
