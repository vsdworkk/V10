Welcome! This guide will walk you through the key steps to make the most of your pitch creation experience. Follow these simple instructions to create a tailored, powerful pitch that meets all job requirements and significantly boosts your chances of landing an interview.

## Answering Questions: Keep it Real!

Before we dive in, it's important to remember you don't need to be overly formal or structured when responding. Think of it like you're chatting with a friend, clearly explaining the actions you took. You don't need to worry about the complexities of the Integrated Leadership System (ILS) or perfectly aligning with selection criteriaâ€”our AI handles all of that. Simply choose an experience that broadly fits the selection criteria and communicate it through our questionnaire.

## Step 1: Role Details Page

Start by entering the core details of the job you're applying for:

- **Role Name**: Enter the exact job title from the job ad (e.g., Data Analyst or Project Manager).
- **Pitch Word Limit**: Add the maximum word count allowed for your pitch as specified in the job pack.
- **APS Classification**: Select the role level, such as APS1, APS2, or EL1.
- **Organisation Name**: Provide the name of the organisation offering the role.
- **Role Description**: Copy and paste the full role description from the job ad, including all key details about the position and department.

## Step 2: Your Experience Page

Paste your resume and any other relevant experience details here.

## Step 3: AI Guidance Phase

After you provide your role details and experience, our AI analyses your background against the role level and selection criteria. It then suggests potential experiences that could be elaborated upon as STAR examples.

_Note: These are recommendations only. If you have a different example that better showcases your skills, feel free to use it._

## Step 4: STAR Phase

Build the core of your pitch by detailing your chosen experiences using the STAR method. This approach helps recruiters understand the context of your achievements, your specific role, the actions you took, and the results you delivered.

### Situation

Set the scene and provide context.

- **Where and when did this occur?** Describe the organisation, team, and approximate time frame.
- **What problem did your team or workplace face?** Clearly articulate the challenge or issue to frame a compelling problem-solving narrative.

### Task

Define your specific responsibilities.

- **What was your responsibility?** Use "I" statements to emphasize your personal involvement and accountability.

### Action

Detail the steps you took.

- **What did you do in each step?** Break down your actions into clear, sequential steps and explain your reasoning.

### Result

Demonstrate the impact of your actions.

- **How did you solve the original problem?** Explain the outcome and quantify your achievements with data where possible (e.g., "reduced processing time by 15%").

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively use APSPitchPro to generate a high-quality, tailored pitch. Remember to review your generated pitch carefully before submission. Good luck with your application!
