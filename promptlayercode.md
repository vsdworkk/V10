data.get("Writer", "")

To get the code from previous nodes^.

Summary of Key Points:
	1.	Writer Output as JSON vs. Python Dict
	•	Often, we see JSON data in logs or console outputs, but it might still be a string in Python. You must call json.loads() on that string to convert it into a Python dictionary. Without that conversion, writer_output remains a string, and checks like isinstance(writer_output, dict) will fail.
	2.	Key Names Must Match Exactly
	•	If the JSON keys (“SituationandTask”, “Action”, “Result”) don’t precisely match what your code looks for, the code block that extracts and concatenates them will never run. Check for typos or mismatched case.
	3.	Code Flow: Fallback
	•	Because of the if/elif structure, if writer_output is not recognized as a dict, the code automatically falls back to returning writer_output as-is. That’s why you might see no joined paragraph if the data isn’t a dictionary.
	4.	Usage of " ".join(...)
	•	This approach merges the text from each section with a space. Alternatively, you could merge with line breaks or other delimiters if needed.
	5.	Typical Fix
	•	Make sure to do something like:

import json

writer_output_str = data.get("Writer", "")
try:
  writer_output_dict = json.loads(writer_output_str)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
  writer_output_dict = {}

	•	Then proceed with the dictionary-based logic (like extracting and concatenating) only if it’s truly a dictionary.

This helps avoid confusion between JSON string data and Python dictionary objects.
